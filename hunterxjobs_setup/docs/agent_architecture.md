## Agent Responsibilities and Interactions

### 1. Project Manager Agent
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Oversee the entire development process
- Coordinate activities between all other agents
- Track progress against project requirements
- Prioritize features and manage development timeline
- Ensure alignment with project goals

**Interactions:**
- Directs the Programmer Agent on what features to implement
- Receives status updates from all agents
- Coordinates with LinkedIn Optimizer Agent on feature priorities
- Ensures Security Agent's requirements are integrated into development

### 2. Programmer Agent
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Develop the HunterXJobs website frontend and backend
- Implement core features as specified in requirements
- Create API endpoints and services
- Build the user interface components
- Integrate with external services (LinkedIn API, etc.)

**Interactions:**
- Receives development tasks from Project Manager Agent
- Sends completed code to Debugger Agent for review
- Collaborates with LinkedIn Optimizer Agent on API integration
- Works with Security Agent to implement security features

### 3. Debugger Agent
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Review code written by the Programmer Agent
- Identify bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities
- Fix issues in the codebase
- Perform code optimization
- Ensure code quality and adherence to best practices

**Interactions:**
- Receives code from Programmer Agent for review
- Communicates issues and fixes back to Programmer Agent
- Works with Security Agent to address security vulnerabilities
- Reports status to Project Manager Agent

### 4. LinkedIn Profile Optimizer Agent
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Implement AI algorithms for profile optimization
- Develop the 78-dimension career potential assessment
- Create content generation capabilities
- Build industry-specific templates and benchmarks
- Implement the viral post probability index

**Interactions:**
- Provides API requirements to Programmer Agent
- Collaborates with Programmer Agent on integration
- Reports progress to Project Manager Agent
- Consults with Security Agent on data privacy concerns

### 5. Security Agent
**Primary Responsibilities:**
- Implement authentication and authorization systems
- Develop security features (encryption, JWT rotation, etc.)
- Create automated penetration testing capabilities
- Ensure compliance with security standards
- Monitor and protect against attacks

**Interactions:**
- Reviews code with Debugger Agent for security issues
- Provides security requirements to Programmer Agent
- Collaborates on implementing security features
- Reports security status to Project Manager Agent

## Technical Implementation

Each agent will be implemented as a Python class with the following components:

1. **Core Logic**: The main functionality of the agent
2. **Communication Interface**: Methods for interacting with other agents
3. **State Management**: Tracking the agent's current status and tasks
4. **Knowledge Base**: Domain-specific information needed by the agent
5. **Decision Making**: Logic for determining next actions

## Agent Communication Protocol

Agents will communicate through a standardized message format:

```json
{
  "sender": "agent_name",
  "receiver": "agent_name",
  "message_type": "request|response|notification",
  "content": {
    "action": "action_name",
    "data": {},
    "priority": "high|medium|low",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp"
  }
}
```

## Development Approach

1. **Agent Framework**: Create a base Agent class with common functionality
2. **Agent Implementation**: Develop each specialized agent by extending the base class
3. **Integration**: Connect agents through the communication protocol
4. **Testing**: Verify agent interactions and system functionality
5. **Deployment**: Package the agent system for easy deployment

## Next Steps

1. Set up the development environment
2. Implement the base Agent class
3. Develop the Project Manager Agent first
4. Incrementally add other agents to the system
5. Test agent interactions and system functionality
