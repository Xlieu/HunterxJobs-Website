- **Debugger Agent**: Reviews code and identifies issues
- **LinkedIn Profile Optimizer Agent**: Analyzes profiles and generates optimization suggestions
- **Security Agent**: Performs security checks and protects against attacks

### 3. Developer Login
A developer account has been created for xenlieu@yahoo.com with the following features:
